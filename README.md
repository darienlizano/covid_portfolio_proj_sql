# Covid-19 Project

## Project Overview
Using current Covid-19 world data (up to June 16th, 2021) from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), I wanted to find interesting insights within current data to discover trends and showcase them. 

## Softwares and Languages
* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft SQL (SSMS)
* Tableau Public

## Data Exploration
Using my [queries](https://github.com/darienlizano/covid_portfolio_proj_sql/blob/main/covid_portfolio_proj.sql) for data exploration. I used the queries to look for certain trends and insights such as total cases against total deaths, total cases compared to country population, retrieving global numbers, etc.

## Queries for Tableau Dashboard
My [queries](https://github.com/darienlizano/covid_portfolio_proj_sql/blob/main/covid_tableau_queries.sql) for my Tableau Dashboard. They differ slightly to my first SQL file for visualization purposes. 

## Exported Queries to Micosoft Excel
After executing my tableau specific queries, I exported each table into separate Microsoft Excel sheets to use them in Tableau Public.
